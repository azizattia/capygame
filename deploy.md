# Quick Railway Deployment Instructions

1. Go to https://railway.app/
2. Sign up with your GitHub account
3. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select this repository: `azizattia/capygame`
5. Railway will auto-deploy the server using our `server.js`
6. It will give you a URL like: `https://capygame-production.up.railway.app`
7. The game will automatically detect and connect to the Railway server

## Why Railway is better:
- Real persistent server (not serverless)
- Perfect for WebSockets/Socket.IO
- Free tier with 500 hours/month
- Auto-deploys from GitHub
- Zero configuration needed
- Proper logging and monitoring

## Alternative: Render.com
If Railway doesn't work, try Render.com - same process, just as reliable.

Your multiplayer game will work perfectly on a real server!
